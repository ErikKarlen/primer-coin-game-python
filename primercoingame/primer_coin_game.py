class PrimerCoinGame:
    """
    A class used to simulate in Python the Coin Game developed by
    Primer.

    In the game there is a blob that is either fair or a cheater and the
    goal of the player is to guess which one the blob is. To find this
    out the player can let the blob flip coins and see the results of
    the flips. For every correct label the player gives it receives
    bonus flips and for every incorrect it is penalised with losing some
    flips. The player starts with a limited number of initial flips.

    The original game created by Primer starts the player with 100 flips
    and the bonus and penalty flips are set to 15 and 30 respectively.

    Primer has made a video with details about the game which you can
    find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC91Bf8hQVo
